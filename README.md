I started out this challenge by following the steps on: https://sass-lang.com/install

I chose to install it through Node.js, however, once I'm done with this challenge I will try the "Install Anywhere (Standalone)" option that is mentioned on the website.

A very interesting video that helped me out a lot in regard to SASS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz6eOVaaelI&t=146s
